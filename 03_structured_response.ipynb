      "- Organ meats: Liver, kidneys, and sweetbreads are high in purines and should be avoided.\n",
      "- Red meat: Limit your intake of beef, pork, and lamb, as they contain moderate to high levels of purines.\n",
      "- Game meats: Meats like venison, rabbit, and pheasant are also high in purines.\n",
      "- Seafood: Sardines, anchovies, herring, mussels, scallops, and trout are particularly high in purines. It is best to limit or avoid these types of seafood.\n",
      "- Alcohol: Alcohol interferes with the removal of uric acid from the body and can trigger gout attacks. Beer and liquor are especially linked to increased gout flare-ups.\n",
      "- Refined carbohydrates and sugary foods: These can increase insulin levels and promote inflammation, which can trigger gout attacks.\n",
      "- Fructose-sweetened drinks: Drinks sweetened with fructose, such as sodas and fruit juices, can increase uric acid levels and should be limited or avoided.\n",
      "- Aspargus and mushrooms: While not as high in purines as other foods on this list, asparagus and mushrooms can still contribute to elevated uric acid levels and should be consumed in moderation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that everyone's sensitivity to these foods may vary, and some people may be able to tolerate small amounts of these foods without triggering a gout attack. It is always best to consult with a doctor or dietitian to determine the best diet plan for managing gout.\n"
